# RespiratoryDisorderAnalysis
RespiratoryDisorderAnalysis

The project aims to classify and predict respiratory disorders from sound data files. The dataset is described and available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database/home

The project has been initialized from my Capstone project for the IBM Advanced Data Science specialization.
The notebooks are initially:

- BNA_Capstone_DataAnalysis_nb.ipynb: initial data analysis,

- BNA_Capstone_Feature_Extraction-v1.0.1.ipynb: initial feature extraction,

- BNA_Capstone_Model_ML-v1.0.1.ipynb: initial ML models, using the ouputs from BNA_Capstone_Feature_Extraction-v1.0.1.ipynb,

- BNA_Capstone_Feature_Extraction-with_Data_Augmentation_v1.2.ipynb: feature extraction with data augmentation,

- BNA_Capstone_Model_ML-v1.3.ipynb: ML models, using the outputs from BNA_Capstone_Feature_Extraction-with_Data_Augmentation_v1.2.ipynb,

- BNA_Capstone_Model_DL-v1.3.2.ipynb: DL models, using the outputs from BNA_Capstone_Feature_Extraction-with_Data_Augmentation_v1.2.ipynb.

To use the notebooks, you can follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repo
2. Download the "Respiratory Disorder" dataset at:
3. Unzip the zip file to /dataset/Respiratory_dataset/ (paths are configurable on the notebooks)
4. Edit the file "demographic_info.txt"; the first line should be empty, remove it and save file

You should be good to go!
